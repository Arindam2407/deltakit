        This class does **not** check that the provided arguments form a valid numerical
        scheme. It is up to the user to ensure that the provided
        ``required_multiples_of_h``, ``coefficients`` and ``derivative_order`` values
        are correct to approximate the desired derivative.

    Args:
        name (str): name of the numerical scheme. Might be used by external functions to
            add metadata to results or name files.
        required_multiples_of_h (Sequence[float]): an **ordered** sequence of numbers
            representing the multiples of the spacing factor ``h``. For example, for the
            second-order central approximation of the second derivative of a function
            (first formula in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Higher-order_differences)

            the points ``x + (-1) * h``, ``x + (0) * h`` and ``x + (1) * h``. Note that
            this sequence should be ordered w.r.t the provided ``coefficients``, i.e.,
            the coefficient in the first entry of the provided ``coefficients`` should
            correspond to the coefficient found in front of the evaluation of the
            function at the point ``x + required_multiples_of_h[0] * h``.
        coefficients (Sequence[float]): weights in the sum that approximates the desired
            derivative. Should be ordered w.r.t the provided ``required_multiples_of_h``.
            For example, for the second-order central approximation of the second
            derivative of a function (first formula in
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Higher-order_differences)
            these would be ``[1, -2, 1]``.
        derivative_order (int): power at which the step ``h`` should be raised in the

    For some functions, the step size ``h`` that should be used to approximate the

    that is using successive powers of ``h`` as step sizes.

    See the documentation of ``scipy.differentiate.derivative`` for a more in-depth

    Warning:
        the ``c`` argument does not follow the same convention as ``scipy``. In
        ``scipy``, powers of ``c`` are used to divide ``h``. In this implementation,
        powers of ``c`` are multiplicative factors of ``h``. That means that ``c > 1``
        will make the steps go further away from the central point when ``order`` is
        increased.
