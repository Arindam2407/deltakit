# Security Policy

Deltakit takes security seriously. If you discover a potential vulnerability, please
report it privately using the
[Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/Deltakit/deltakit/security) feature on
our repository. To minimize risk while we investigate the issue, please do *not*
discuss the concern in a GitHub issue, pull request, or other public forum.

In your private report, please include:
- a description of the issue and how it might be exploited,
- your assessment of the severity of the threat,
- steps that would trigger the vulnerability (if applicable),
- any related platform or configuration details, and
- information about any exploitations that have already occurred.

Once received, we will immediately acknowledge your report and reply with next steps.
We will keep you informed of progress towards a fix, and we may ask for additional
information or guidance. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate the disclosure
notice with you, making every effort to credit your contribution unless you prefer
to remain anonymous.

Thank you for your support!
